    During my first days on my new diet, my body was adjusting to a lack of carbohydrates.
    My breakfast consists of eggs and bacon and i've ate nothing but meats and greens for lunch and dinner.
    I noticed my body felt a lot weaker and I wasn't able to exercise with the same sort of energy I had prior to this diet.
    One thing I have noticed though is that my hunger has diminished.
    The foods I have been eating don't give me the feeling of being full, but they give me the feeling of my hunger being satisfied.
    These are two distinct feelings. When I was full from eating something like pasta or pizza, I felt bloated and in pain.

    It has officially been one week since I started the ketogenic diet and I would like to share my experience.
    Firstly, my diet has consisted mostly of eggs, bacon, broccoli, and chicken. I have learned to love cooking.
    On this diet, virtually all of fast-food is not an option.
    I have had to cut out a lot of my favorite sweets, but I learned how to make alternative sweet-tasting foods conducive to my diet.
    In the past week, I've cooked a batch of cream-cheese cookies that tasted delicious and satisfied my sweet tooth.
     I have noticed that my energy levels are less variable and tend to stay consistent from the beginning of the day to the end.
     Overall, I feel really good and i'll account for more of my experiences in a week.

    I have noticed an elimination of all carbohydrate cravings. I had worried that the cravings for my favorite carb-rich foods would cause me to quit.
    I no longer feel weak from the carbohydrate withdrawal.
    The food I have been eating has been largely the same since week one and that's because I have been really enjoying it.
    A difference i've noticed with this diet as opposed to some others that i've tried is that I think the food options are very tasty.
